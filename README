Name
    memc-nginx-module - An extended version of the standard memcached module
    that supports set, add, delete, and many more memcached commands.

    *This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.* See the
    installation instructions.

Version
    This document describes memc-nginx-module v0.13rc2
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/memc-nginx-module/tags>) released on 24
    November 2011.

Description
    This module extends the standard [module (HttpMemcachedModule)] to
    support almost the whole memcached ascii protocol
    (<http://code.sixapart.com/svn/memcached/trunk/server/doc/protocol.txt>)
    .

    It allows you to define a custom REST
    (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST>) interface to your memcached
    servers or access memcached in a very efficient way from within the
    nginx server by means of subrequests or independent fake requests
    (<http://github.com/srlindsay/nginx-independent-subrequest>).

    This module is not supposed to be merged into the Nginx core because
    I've used Ragel (<http://www.complang.org/ragel/>) to generate the
    memcached response parsers (in C) for joy :)

    If you are going to use this module to cache location responses out of
    the box, try [[HttpSRCacheModule]] with this module to achieve that.

  Keep-alive connections to memcached servers
    You need [[HttpUpstreamKeepaliveModule]] together with this module for
    keep-alive TCP connections to your backend memcached servers.

    Here's a sample configuration:

      http {
        upstream backend {
          server 127.0.0.1:11211;

          # a pool with at most 1024 connections
          # and do not distinguish the servers:
          keepalive 1024 single;
        }

        server {
            ...
            location /memc {
                set $memc_cmd get;
                set $memc_key $arg_key;
                memc_pass backend;
            }
        }
      }

  How it works
    It implements the memcached TCP protocol all by itself, based upon the
    "upstream" mechansim. Everything involving I/O is non-blocking.

    The module itself does not keep TCP connections to the upstream
    memcached servers across requests, just like other upstream modules. For
    a working solution, see section Keep-alive connections to memcached
    servers.

Memcached commands supported
    The memcached storage commands set, add, replace, prepend, and append
    uses the $memc_key as the key, $memc_exptime as the expiration time (or
    delay) (defaults to 0), $memc_flags as the flags (defaults to 0), to
    build the corresponding memcached queries.

    If $memc_value is not defined at all, then the request body will be used
    as the value of the $memc_value except for the incr and decr commands.
    Note that if $memc_value is defined as an empty string (""), that empty
    string will still be used as the value as is.

    The following memcached commands have been implemented and tested (with
    their parameters marked by corresponding nginx variables defined by this
    module):

  get $memc_key
    Retrieves the value using a key.

      location /foo {
          set $memc_cmd 'get';
          set $memc_key 'my_key';

          memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;

          add_header X-Memc-Flags $memc_flags;
      }

    Returns "200 OK" with the value put into the response body if the key is
    found, or "404 Not Found" otherwise. The "flags" number will be set into
    the $memc_flags variable so it's often desired to put that info into the
    response headers by means of the standard [directive
    (HttpHeadersModule#add_header)].

    It returns 502 for "ERROR", "CLIENT_ERROR", or "SERVER_ERROR".

  set $memc_key $memc_flags $memc_exptime $memc_value
    To use the request body as the memcached value, just avoid setting the
    $memc_value variable:

      # POST /foo
      # my value...
      location /foo {
          set $memc_cmd 'set';
          set $memc_key 'my_key';
          set $memc_flags 12345;
          set $memc_exptime 24;

          memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
      }

    Or let the $memc_value hold the value:

      location /foo {
          set $memc_cmd 'set';
          set $memc_key 'my_key';
          set $memc_flags 12345;
          set $memc_exptime 24;
          set $memc_value 'my_value';

          memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
      }

    Returns "201 Created" if the upstream memcached server replies "STORED",
    200 for "NOT_STORED", 404 for "NOT_FOUND", 502 for "ERROR",
    "CLIENT_ERROR", or "SERVER_ERROR".

    The original memcached responses are returned as the response body
    except for "404 NOT FOUND".

  add $memc_key $memc_flags $memc_exptime $memc_value
    Similar to the set command.

  replace $memc_key $memc_flags $memc_exptime $memc_value
    Similar to the set command.

  append $memc_key $memc_flags $memc_exptime $memc_value
    Similar to the set command.

    Note that at least memcached version 1.2.2 does not support the "append"
    and "prepend" commands. At least 1.2.4 and later versions seem to
    supports these two commands.

  prepend $memc_key $memc_flags $memc_exptime $memc_value
    Similar to the append command.

  delete $memc_key
    Deletes the memcached entry using a key.

      location /foo
          set $memc_cmd delete;
          set $memc_key my_key;

          memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
      }

    Returns "200 OK" if deleted successfully, "404 Not Found" for
    "NOT_FOUND", or 502 for "ERROR", "CLIENT_ERROR", or "SERVER_ERROR".

    The original memcached responses are returned as the response body
    except for "404 NOT FOUND".

  delete $memc_key $memc_exptime
    Similar to the delete $memc_key command except it accepts an optional
    "expiration" time specified by the $memc_exptime variable.

    This command is no longer available in the latest memcached version
    1.4.4.

  incr $memc_key $memc_value
    Increments the existing value of $memc_key by the amount specified by
    $memc_value:

      location /foo {
          set $memc_key my_key;
          set $memc_value 2;
          memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
      }

    In the preceding example, every time we access "/foo" will cause the
    value of "my_key" increments by 2.

    Returns "200 OK" with the new value associated with that key as the
    response body if successful, or "404 Not Found" if the key is not found.

    It returns 502 for "ERROR", "CLIENT_ERROR", or "SERVER_ERROR".

  decr $memc_key $memc_value
    Similar to incr $memc_key $memc_value.

  flush_all
    Mark all the keys on the memcached server as expired:

      location /foo {
          set $memc_cmd flush_all;
          memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
      }

  flush_all $memc_exptime
    Just like flush_all but also accepts an expiration time specified by the
    $memc_exptime variable.

  stats
    Causes the memcached server to output general-purpose statistics and
    settings

      location /foo {
          set $memc_cmd stats;
          memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
      }

    Returns "200 OK" if the request succeeds, or 502 for "ERROR",
    "CLIENT_ERROR", or "SERVER_ERROR".

    The raw "stats" command output from the upstream memcached server will
    be put into the response body.

  version
    Queries the memcached server's version number:

      location /foo {
          set $memc_cmd version;
          memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
      }

    Returns "200 OK" if the request succeeds, or 502 for "ERROR",
    "CLIENT_ERROR", or "SERVER_ERROR".

    The raw "version" command output from the upstream memcached server will
    be put into the response body.

Directives
    All the standard [module (HttpMemcachedModule)] directives in nginx
    0.8.28 are directly inherited, with the "memcached_" prefixes replaced
    by "memc_". For example, the "memcached_pass" directive is spelled
    "memc_pass".

    Here we only document the most important two directives (the latter is a
    new directive introduced by this module).

  memc_pass
    syntax: *memc_pass <memcached server IP address>:<memcached server
    port>*

    syntax: *memc_pass <memcached server hostname>:<memcached server port>*

    syntax: *memc_pass <upstream_backend_name>*

    syntax: *memc_pass unix:<path_to_unix_domain_socket>*

    default: *none*

    context: *http, server, location, if*

    phase: *content*

    Specify the memcached server backend.

  memc_cmds_allowed
    syntax: *memc_cmds_allowed <cmd>...*

    default: *none*

    context: *http, server, location, if*

    Lists memcached commands that are allowed to access. By default, all the
    memcached commands supported by this module are accessible. An example
    is

       location /foo {
           set $memc_cmd $arg_cmd;
           set $memc_key $arg_key;
           set $memc_value $arg_val;

           memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;

           memc_cmds_allowed get;
       }

  memc_flags_to_last_modified
    syntax: *memc_flags_to_last_modified on|off*

    default: *off*

    context: *http, server, location, if*

    Read the memcached flags as epoch seconds and set it as the value of the
    "Last-Modified" header. For conditional GET, it will signal nginx to
    return "304 Not Modified" response to save bandwidth.

  memc_connect_timeout
    syntax: *memc_connect_timeout <time>*

    default: *60s*

    context: *http, server, location*

    The timeout for connecting to the memcached server, in seconds by
    default.

    It's wise to always explicitly specify the time unit to avoid confusion.
    Time units supported are "s"(seconds), "ms"(milliseconds), "y"(years),
    "M"(months), "w"(weeks), "d"(days), "h"(hours), and "m"(minutes).

    This time must be less than 597 hours.

  memc_send_timeout
    syntax: *memc_send_timeout <time>*

    default: *60s*

    context: *http, server, location*

    The timeout for sending TCP requests to the memcached server, in seconds
    by default.

    It's wise to always explicitly specify the time unit to avoid confusion.
    Time units supported are "s"(seconds), "ms"(milliseconds), "y"(years),
    "M"(months), "w"(weeks), "d"(days), "h"(hours), and "m"(minutes).

    This time must be less than 597 hours.

  memc_read_timeout
    syntax: *memc_read_timeout <time>*

    default: *60s*

    context: *http, server, location*

    The timeout for reading TCP responses from the memcached server, in
    seconds by default.

    It's wise to always explicitly specify the time unit to avoid confusion.
    Time units supported are "s"(seconds), "ms"(milliseconds), "y"(years),
    "M"(months), "w"(weeks), "d"(days), "h"(hours), and "m"(minutes).

    This time must be less than 597 hours.

  memc_buffer_size
    syntax: *memc_buffer_size <size>*

    default: *4k/8k*

    context: *http, server, location*

    This buffer size is used for the memory buffer to hold

    *   the complete response for memcached commands other than "get",

    *   the complete response header (i.e., the first line of the response)
        for the "get" memcached command.

    This default size is the page size, may be "4k" or "8k".

Installation
    You're recommended to install this module (as well as the Nginx core and
    many other goodies) via the ngx_openresty bundle
    (<http://openresty.org>). See the installation steps
    (<http://openresty.org/#Installation>) for "ngx_openresty".

    Alternatively, you can compile this module into the standard Nginx
    source distribution by hand:

    Grab the nginx source code from nginx.org (<http://nginx.org/>), for
    example, the version 1.0.8 (see nginx compatibility), and then build the
    source with this module:

        wget 'http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.0.8.tar.gz'
        tar -xzvf nginx-1.0.8.tar.gz
        cd nginx-1.0.8/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/memc-nginx-module

        make -j2
        make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    memc-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/memc-nginx-module/tags>).

  For Developers
    The memached response parsers were generated by Ragel
    (<http://www.complang.org/ragel/>). If you want to regenerate the
    parser's C file, i.e., src/ngx_http_memc_response.c
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/memc-nginx-module/blob/master/src/ngx_http_m
    emc_response.c>), use the following command from the root of the memc
    module's source tree:

        $ ragel -G2 src/ngx_http_memc_response.rl

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   1.1.x (last tested: 1.1.5)

    *   1.0.x (last tested: 1.0.10)

    *   0.9.x (last tested: 0.9.4)

    *   0.8.x (last tested: 0.8.54)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.46 (last tested: 0.7.68)

    It's worth mentioning that some 0.7.x versions older than 0.7.46 might
    also work, but I can't easily test them because the test suite makes
    extensive use of the [module (HttpEchoModule)]'s [directive
    (HttpEchoModule#echo_location)], which requires at least nginx 0.7.46 :)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.46 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

Report Bugs
    Although a lot of effort has been put into testing and code tuning,
    there must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere in this module. So
    whenever you are bitten by any quirks, please don't hesitate to

    1.  create a ticket on the issue tracking interface
        (<http://github.com/agentzh/memc-nginx-module/issues>) provided by
        GitHub,

    2.  or send a bug report or even patches to the nginx mailing list
        (<http://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx>).

ChangeLog
  v0.12
    *   fixed the spots that trigger the unused-but-set-variable warning by
        gcc 4.6.

    *   added more debug information when memcached sends back "invalid"
        responses.

    *   we now document the timeout units properly. it should default to
        seconds.

    *   now we use the 2-clause bsd license.

    *   added an error message when no upstream backend is found in
        "memc_pass $backend".

  v0.11
    *   fixed the zero size buf alert in error.log when $memc_value is set
        to empty (""). thanks iframist.

  v0.10
    *   we no longer use the problematic "ngx_strXcmp" macros in our source
        because it may cause invalid reads and thus segmentation faults.
        thanks Piotr Sikora.

  v0.09
    *   now we copy out "r->request_body->bufs" for our memcached request to
        avoid modifying the original request body. Thanks Matthieu Tourne.

  v0.08
    *   now the memc commands other than get work with subrequests in
        memory. Thanks Yao Xinming for reporting it. Using storage memcached
        commands in ngx_eval module's eval blocks no longer hang the server.

  v0.07
    *   applied the patch from nginx 0.8.35 that fixed a bug that ngx_eval
        may issue the incorrect error message "memcached sent invalid
        trailer".

  v0.06
    *   implemented the memc_flags_to_last_modified directive.

    *   added a new variable named $memc_flags_as_http_time.

  v0.05
    *   removed the "memc_bind" directive since it won't compile with nginx
        0.8.31.

  v0.04
    *   to ensure Maxim's ngx_http_upstream_keepalive
        (<http://mdounin.ru/hg/ngx_http_upstream_keepalive/>) module caches
        our connections even if "u->headers_in->status" is 201 (Created).

    *   updated docs to make it clear that this module can work with
        "upstream" multi-server backends. thanks Bernd Dorn for reporting
        it.

  v0.03
    *   fixed a connection leak caused by an extra "r->main->count++"
        operation: we should NOT do "r->main->count++" after calling the
        "ngx_http_read_client_request_body" function in our content handler.

  v0.02
    *   applied the (minor) optimization trick suggested by Marcus Clyne:
        creating our variables and save their indexes at post-config phase
        when the memc_pass directive is actually used in the config file.

  v0.01
    *   initial release.

Test Suite
    This module comes with a Perl-driven test suite. The test cases
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/memc-nginx-module/tree/master/t/>) are
    declarative
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/memc-nginx-module/blob/master/t/storage.t>)
    too. Thanks to the Test::Base
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Base>) module in the Perl world.

    To run it on your side:

        $ PATH=/path/to/your/nginx-with-memc-module:$PATH prove -r t

    You need to terminate any Nginx processes before running the test suite
    if you have changed the Nginx server binary.

    Either LWP::UserAgent (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::UserAgent>)
    or IO::Socket (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IO::Socket>) is used by
    the test scaffold
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/memc-nginx-module/blob/master/test/lib/Test/
    Nginx/LWP.pm>).

    Because a single nginx server (by default, "localhost:1984") is used
    across all the test scripts (".t" files), it's meaningless to run the
    test suite in parallel by specifying "-jN" when invoking the "prove"
    utility.

    You should also keep a memcached server listening on the 11211 port at
    localhost before running the test suite.

    Some parts of the test suite requires modules rewrite and echo to be
    enabled as well when building Nginx.

TODO
    *   add support for the memcached commands "cas", "gets" and "stats
        $memc_value".

    *   add support for the "noreply" option.

Getting involved
    You'll be very welcomed to submit patches to the author or just ask for
    a commit bit to the source repository on GitHub.
